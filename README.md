# crime-project

This project allows the user to access FBI crime data for each state in the United States. The page includes an interactive map. The data is added to a sortable table at the bottom of the page that makes data analysis easier. This page makes use of the FBI's crime data API. Additionally, it uses Isotope.js in order to add sort functionality to the table. A sparse but intuitive interface makes it clear how the user should proceed upon first accessing the page.
